  ///
  /// \par The getter functions for the data construct the final output based on the data and
  /// metadata in these lookup tables. There are many complications. For one the data may be
  /// jagged (lookup table instances do not necessarily all have the same number of elements
  /// [repeated data could have a different number of repeats per instance]). Another is the
  /// application group_by fields which affect the dimensionality of the data. In order to make
  /// the data into rectangular arrays it may be necessary to strategically fill in missing values
  /// so that the data is organized correctly in each dimension.
